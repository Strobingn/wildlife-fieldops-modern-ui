## 2025-05-18 - Eliminating `deepClone` on Pub/Sub State Store Reads and Updates
**Learning:** In a central JS pub/sub store with large collections, performing `deepClone` (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state))`) on every `getState()`, `setState()`, `subscribe()`, and `select()` call creates massive serialization overhead (~800ms per 1000 ops). `Object.freeze` provides immutability protection at top-level state without cloning overhead.
**Action:** Prefer `Object.freeze` or shallow structural updates over `deepClone` on frequent state store access paths.
